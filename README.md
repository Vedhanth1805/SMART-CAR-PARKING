# 🚗 Smart Car Parking System

## 🔍 Overview
This is a basic smart parking system project that simulates how a toll gate operates using sensors. When a car arrives, the sensor detects it and automatically opens the gate, allowing the vehicle to enter.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Arduino / Sensor Hardware (if applicable)
- Python / Embedded C / Serial Communication (based on what you used)
- Simulation tools (Proteus / TinkerCAD / etc.)

## 🚀 Features
- Sensor detects approaching vehicle
- Automatic gate opening
- Simple simulation of real-world smart parking

## 📸 Screenshots / GIF (Optional)
*Add screenshots or a GIF of how your system works, if possible*

## 🧠 Future Improvements
- Add license plate recognition
- Add mobile app control or booking system
- Count available slots
